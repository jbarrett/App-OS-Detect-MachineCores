= SYNOPSIS

On different systems, different approaches are needed to detect the number of cores for that machine.

This Module is a wrapper around these different approaches.

= USAGE

This is the executable to [App::OS::Detect::MachineCores], please see the documentation there for usage.

= WARNING
Some questions with Dist::Zilla are still open, and although this module attempts to load [Mouse] instead of [Moose],
unfortuantely, however, *both* modules are installed as prerequisites. This will change soon.
